    <p>Think fast... Simon says, "Chase my flashing lights and sounds"!</p>
    <p>
      The challenge is to repeat the ever-increasing random signals that Simon
      generates
    </p>
    <p>
      In any case, you are sure to enjoy hours of challenging fun with Simon
    </p>

    <h2 class="instruction">General Description</h2>
    <p>
      SIMON is a computer-controlled game that consists of a base unit with 4
      color lenses and a control panel.
    </p>
    <p>Press any button on your keyboard to start the Simon Game.</p>

    <h1 class="instruction">To Play</h1>
    <ol class="instruction">
      <li>
        Press any button on your keyboard to start the Simon Game, and Simon
        will give the first signal.
      </li>
      <li>Repeat the signal by pressing the same lens</li>
      <li>Simon will duplicate the first signal and will add one.</li>
      <li>Repeat these two signals by pressing the same lenses.</li>
      <li>Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.</li>
      <li>
        Continue in this manner as long as you can repeat each sequence of
        signals correctly.
      </li>
      <li>
        !!! Notice that after the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon
        automatically increases the tempo.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly or if you take more than 5
        seconds to repeat a signal, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound; you have
        lost, and this sequence of signals is over.
      </li>
    </ol>
